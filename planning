Step 1: Set up the project structure

- Create a new HTML file (index.html) for the user interface
- Create a new JavaScript file (script.js) for the logic
- Create a new CSS file (style.css) for styling

Step 2: Define the data structures

- Create an array of lotto numbers (1-52)
- Create an array of ball colors (red, yellow, green, blue)
- Create an object to store ticket data (ticketNumber, boards, numbers, price)
- Create an object to store draw data (winningNumbers, date)

Step 3: Set up the user interface

- Create HTML elements for user input (number selection, board selection)
- Create HTML elements for displaying ticket information (ticket number, boards, price)
- Create HTML elements for displaying draw results (winning numbers, date)

Step 4: Implement ticket generation and pricing

- Write a function to generate a ticket based on user input (selectNumbers())
- Write a function to calculate the ticket price based on the number of boards (calculatePrice())

Step 5: Implement draw simulation and winning logic

- Write a function to simulate the draw and generate winning numbers (simulateDraw())
- Write a function to determine winners based on ticket numbers and winning numbers (determineWinners())

Step 6: Implement data persistence and retrieval

- Write a function to save ticket data to localStorage (saveTicket())
- Write a function to retrieve ticket data from localStorage (getTicket())

Step 7: Implement notifications and alerts

- Write a function to display notifications for winners (displayNotification())
- Write a function to alert the admin of winners (alertAdmin())

Step 8: Implement the main logic

- Write a function to initialize the application and load data (initApp())
- Write a function to handle user input and selections (handleUserInput())
- Write a function to simulate the draw and update the display (simulateDrawAndDisplay())

Step 9: Test and debug the code

- Test the code to ensure it works as expected
- Debug any issues that arise
